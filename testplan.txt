Test #1:
First we malloc integer values so we can throw them in the list.
The numbers are inserted accordingly:
34, 43, 6, 26, 41
After they are inserted the list is sorted from largest to smallest as:
43, 41, 34, 26, 6 

Test #2:
After all of the numbers from test 1 have been inserted and printed, we remove:
34, 6
The list then prints out:
43, 41, 26

Test #3:
Now we create a new list that will insert doubles that we malloc
The numbers are inserted respectively as:
53.75, 67.3, 42.281, 42.111, 42.9018
After insertion they are in order from largest to smallest as:
67.300000, 53.750000, 42.901800, 42.281000, 42.111000

Test#4:
After the doubles are inserted in order we remove three doubles from the list:
53.75, 42.281, 42.111
The list then has:
67.300000, 42.901800

Test#5:
Now we malloc char* or strings so we can insert them into the list as following:
"hello", "world", "what are", "up to", "today"
The list then is sorted as:
"world", "what are", "up to", "today", "world"

Test#6
We then try to remove an item from the list that does not exists:
"yo"
The program then says:
"We can't find the object"
